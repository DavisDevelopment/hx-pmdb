 A package directory for Haxe modules created from the closest thing to a line-by-line, one-to-one port of [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb)
that I could manage, for those subsystems of nedb (this project's main inspiration) that I think would be best replicated
by first translating into Haxe, 1 line at a time, testing the translation and then creating a second,
separate implementation of the particular algorithm by attempting to streamline the first translation. 

 Lastly, #1 functions should be benchmarked against #2 functions, just to verify that #2 doesn't just *look* more efficient, but *is* more efficient.
