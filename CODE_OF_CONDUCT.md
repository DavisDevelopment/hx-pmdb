# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of PmDB is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of any/all individual characteristics, immutable or otherwise, which cannot reasonably be interpreted as directly relevant to the following:
 - The PmDB project as a whole
 - The quality of the contribution(s) of the individual or entity
   - (generally measured in terms of effectiveness, performance and feature-completeness, though additional metrics may be considered when deemed reasonable by the project owner)

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in PmDB to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning or discriminatory behavior and speech.
   * "discriminatory speech", in this context, should be interpreted to mean: "Speech which is discriminatory of persons or their work, and that can reasonably be described as any of the following:
     * unnecessarily aggressive or rude
     * primarily based on characteristics which are either demonstrably fictitious or which cannot reasonably be considered relevant to the situation
     * objectively (or reasonably interpretable as) hostile or unwelcoming of a specific group or groups of people, based on criteria which are either not clearly defined, or non-behavioral (e.g. behavioral criteria are necessarily acceptible, else this document would itself qualify as discriminatory)

 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 * Physical violence, or threats thereof directed against another person.
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit material.
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 * Personal insults.
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes:
   * Objectively sexualized comments or jokes.
   * Comments or jokes that have previously been explicitly deemed unwelcome by the subject or subjects thereof, unless the person making them was (or may reasonably have been) unaware that such speech was unwelcome.
   * Deliberate physical contact with another person which is sexual in nature, or has been communicated to be unwelcome.
   * Continuous, repeated or otherwise known-to-be-unwelcome sexual advances.
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
 * Advocating for, encouraging, stating intent for, or otherwise articulating positive personal thoughts about any of the above behavior.
 * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## 5. Weapons Policy

There are no specific policies regarding weapons at PmDB events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct, insofar as the possession, concealment, or use in any way of these items is in full compliance with all state and local laws on this matter.
<!---
No weapons will be allowed at PmDB events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.
-->

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 7. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. epikit@gmail.com.

## 8. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify DavisDevelopment with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. 


## 9. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the physical safety of community members.

This document is derived from The Citizen Code of Conduct. It has been amended in order to minimize the degree to which the interpretation of this document and its policies can reasonably vary between individuals. 

Clearer definitions of terms and phrases have been added, and efforts have been made to reduce the degree to which any of these policies might be misused. 

Policies which define things as being unacceptible based upon criteria which are overly broad in scope, poorly defined or primarily subjective have been removed, given more specific descriptions, or replaced with comparable policies which use more objective metrics for determining acceptibility, and which have more verbose descriptions.
